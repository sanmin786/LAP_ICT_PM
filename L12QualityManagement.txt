QM has three main processes
1)Planning
    Planning Quality Management
        Functionality(add to carts,payment system)
        System Outputs (screens, reports)=>(invoices for users, sales report for admins)
        Performance (to meet intented user's ecpectations)
        Realiability (warranty service, waterproof)
        Maintainability (adding features, storage to current web)
2)Executing
    Perform Quality Asssurance
        Quality Asssurance => continuous quality improvement according to quality standards
        Kaizen => change for the better
        Lean => maximize customer value while minimizing waste
        Benchmarking => comparing project practices within or outside the performing organization
        Quality Audit => to check the current projects and helps identify lessons learned for improvement

3)Monitoring and Controlling
    Perform Quality Control
        Main Outcomes => acceptance decisions, rework and process adjustments
        Acceptance decisions
            Accepted or Rejected
            If accepted,considered to be validated deliverables
            If rejected, must be rework
        Rework  
            action taken to be compliance with product requirements, specifications or other stakeholder expectations
        Process adjustments
            prevent quality problems based on quality control measurements

Tools and techniques for Quality Control
1)Cause-and-effect diagrams(ask why) => help find the root cause of a problem
2)A control chart => results of process over time
3)A checksheet => to collect and analyze data (for compliant)
4)A Scatter diagram => relationship between the two variables, the more closely the two variables are related
5)A Histogram => bar graph of a distribution of variables
6)A Pareto chart => a histogram that can help identify and priortize problems (for compliant)
7)Flowcharts => (yes/no solution)
8)A run chart => the history and pattern of variation of a process over time

Six Sigma
Target achievement of no more than 3.4 defects, errors or mistakes
follow five phase princle (DMAIC)
    Define
        Define problem /opportunity
    Measure
        Display data
    Analyze
        find improvement opportunities based on data
    Improve
        generate solutions and ideas
    Control
        track and verify
