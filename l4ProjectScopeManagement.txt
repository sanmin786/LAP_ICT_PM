Deliverables => product related or process related
product related=> a piece of hardware/software
process related=> planning document

Project Scope Management
-planning
-controlling and monitoring

Two important outputs of Planning Scope Management
1 scope management plan
2 requirements management plan

Scope Management Plan
How to prepare a detailed project scope statement
How to create WBS
How to maintain and approve WBS
How to obtain formal acceptance of the completed project Deliverables
How to control requests for changes to the project scope

Requirements Management Plan
How to plan,track and report requirements activities
How to perform configuration management activities
How  to prioritize requirements
How to use product metrics
How to trace and capture attributes of requirements

Collecting Requirements
-Interviewing stakeholders - very effective
-Holding focus groups and facilitated workshops - normally faster
-Questionnaires and surveys
-Observation
-Benchmarking

Defining Scope
Tools and techniques => expert judgement, product analysis,workshops
Main Outputs => project scope statement and project documents updates

Approaches to Developing Work Breakdown Structure
-Using guidelines
-The analogy approach
-The top-down approach (Theory Based)
-The bottom-up approach (Data Based)
-The mind-mapping approach

WBS should appear only one place in the WBS

Validating Scope
Scope creep - tendency for project to keep getting bigger and bigger
Scope Validation - formal acceptance of the completed project deliverables
Main Outputs=> accepted deliverables, change requests, work performance information

Tool for controlling scope => Variance Analysis (the difference between planned and actual performance)
Outputs of scope control => change requests, updates about project management plan, project document, organizational project assets

6 Processes of Project Scope Management
