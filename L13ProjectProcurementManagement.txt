Procurement => acquiring goods and services from an outside source
Who provide => suppliers, vendors, contractors,sellers

Project Procurement Management
Four Processes
1)Planning Procurement Management
    deciding whether to procure (yes/no)
    how to procure (cash or card)
    what to procure (choice of brand, specifications)
    how much to procure (budget)
    when to procure ()
Output => make-or-buy decision (make inside the organization or buy from outside)
Inputs=> project management plan, requirements documentation, the risk register, activity resource requirments, project schedule, activity cost estimates, stakeholder register, enterprise environment factors and organizational process assets such as contacts

Types of contracts
1)Fixed-price or lump-sum contracts
    fixed total proce for a well-defined product or service
2)Cost-reimbursable contracts
    payment to the supplier for direct or indirect actual costs
3)Time and material (T&M)
    a hybrid of fixed-price and cost-reimbursable contacts

Statment of Work (SOW)
    description of the work required for the procurement

A contract SOW should be clear, concise

Procurement Documents (required for large procurements)
Request for proposal(RFP)   => a document used to solicit proposals from prospective suppliers
                            => a proposal is prepared by a seller when there different approaches for meeting buyer's needs

Request for Quote(RFQ)      => a document prepared by sellers to provide pricing for standard items that the buyer has clearly defined


2)Conducting procurements
    sending documents to potential sellers

3)Controlling procurements
    seller's performance meets contactual requirements
    Changes need to be reviewed, approved and documented
    Evaluation of an change should include impact analysis
    Changes must be documented in writing

    *Do not assume that everything will go well becuase you hired a reputable supplier*

    Have backup plans in case the new system does not work as planned

4)Closing procurements
    contact closure
