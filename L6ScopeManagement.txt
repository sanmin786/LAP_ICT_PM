Planning Cost Management
Level of accuracy
Units of measure ->labor hours ->roundign to the nearest
Organizational procedures links -> WBS
Control thresholds -> 10% of baseline cost
Rules of performance measurement -> EVM(Earned Value Management)
Reporting formats -> frquency of cost reports
Process Description -> 

Estimating costs
Three basic types of estimate
1)rough order of magnitude (ROM) estimate -> 3-5 year project  |Accuracy Low
-made very early
-made project initiation phase
-use Top-Down estimating

2)budgetary estimate -> 1-2 year project |Acuracy Medium
-made during project planning phase
-use top-down estimating

3)definitive estimate -> less than 1 year project |Accuracy High
-made during planning phase or late phase
-use bottom-up estimating

Tools for estimating costs
Analogous Estimating(Top-Down Estimating)
-estimate both duration and cost
-use historical data
-fastest technique
-less accurate

Bottom-up Estimating
-estimate resources, duration and cost
-more accurate
-maximun amount of time and effort to estimate

Three-Point Estimating
-estimate both duration and cost
-more accurate than analogous and parametric Estimating
-consideration of risk, uncertainty
-used when there is insufficient data

Parametric Estimating
-used to estimate resources,duration and cost
-use historical data and project parameters
-accuracy better than analogous

--------------------------------------------------
Typical Problems with IT Cost Estimates
-Done too quickly
-Lack estimating experience
-Biased toward underestimation
-Management desires accuracy

Controlling costs
Inputs=> project management plan, project funding requirements, work performance data and organization process assets

Earned Value Management (EVM) has three values
Planned Value (PV) =>cost estimate planned to do activity
Actual Cost(AC) => total direct + indirect cost
Earned Value(EV) => work actually completed
Rate of performance (RP)
Cost Variance(CV) => EV - AC
Schedule Variance (SV) => EV - PV
CPI => ratio of EV to AC
CPI = 1 OR 100% =>Budgeted
CPI = less than 1 or 100% => Over Budget
CPI = more than 1 or 100% => Under Budget

SPI => ratio of EV to PV
SPI = 1 OR 100% => on schedule
SPI = less than 1 or 100% => behind schedule
SPI = more than 1 or 100% => ahead of schedule
