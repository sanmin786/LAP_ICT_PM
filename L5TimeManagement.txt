Time Management
7 Main Processes
1 to 6 => Planning
7 => Controlling

Planning Schedule Management

1)schedule model
2)methodology and tool (eg, Gannchart)
3)Level of accuracy
4)control thresholds (performance)
5)Rules
6)Reporting formats
7)Process Descriptions

CPA(Crtical Path Analysis)
-show the shortest path and time taken

Gannchart
-show details of schedule
--------------------------------------------------------
Defining Activities
task found on WBS
Outputs=> activity list, activity attributes, milestone
Activity List => Name, Description
Activity Attributes => Resources, Duration, Constraints
Milestone => Name, Description
---------------------------------------------------------
Sequencing Activities
Documenting the relationship between project activities
Outputs => project schedule network diagram, project document updates
Dependencies => Mandatory Dependencies, Discretionary Dependencies, External Dependencies

-Mandatory Dependencies (must be)
contracts,laws,physical limitations

-Discretionary Dependencies
best practices, business knowledge

-External Dependencies
Relationships between project and non-project activities
------------------------------------------------------
Task Dependencies
Finish to Start
Start to Start
Finish to Finish
Start to Finish
--------------------------------------------
Network Diagram
uses activity-on-arrow(AOA), arrow diagram method(ADM), PDM

Burst => two or more ativities from a single node
Marge => two or more nodes meet at a single node
------------------------------------------------------
Estimating activity resources
people,equipment, materials
Outputs => resource requirements, resource breakdown structure, project document updates
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Activity Duration Estimate
Duration = The actual amount of time worked on an activity + elapsed time
---------------------------------------------------------------
Developing the schedule
Gannt Chart
Critical Path Analysis

SMART Criteria in Gannt Chart
Specific
Measurable
Assignable
Realistic
Time-framed

Critical Path Method
The longest path is the critical path
Slack or float => amount of time an activity may be delayed
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Controlling changes to the project schedule
-manage changes (should/should not)

Reality Checks on Scheduling
-review draft schedule in project charter
-meeting with stakeholders

Working with people issues
Project Managers need several leadership skills
-Empowerment
-Incentives
-Discipline
-Negotiation
